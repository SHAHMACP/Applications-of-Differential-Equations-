## Lotka-Volterra Predator-Prey Model


This classical ecological model shows how predator and prey populations interact using a nonlinear first-order differential system. It assumes exponential growth for prey and predator death in absence of prey, with interaction terms modeling encounters.

Equations:
- dx/dt = ax - bxy
- dy/dt = -cy + dxy

Equilibrium and phase portraits show the dynamics. Jacobian matrix and eigenvalues at critical points help determine local stability and behavior (center, saddle).
