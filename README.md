# Applications of Differential Equations

This repository presents a study on real-world applications of differential equations, completed as part of a B.Sc. Mathematics project.

## Project Overview

Differential equations are powerful tools for modeling various phenomena in physics, biology, engineering, and beyond. This project investigates the use of differential equations in the following contexts:

### 1. Lotka-Volterra Predator-Prey Model
Models population dynamics using nonlinear first-order differential equations. This system helps visualize predator-prey relationships and their equilibrium through phase portraits and Jacobian analysis.

### 2. Satellite Motion
Explains how Newton’s laws and central force systems describe satellite orbits using polar coordinates. Includes derivation of equations and discussion of Kepler's laws of planetary motion.

### 3. Tacoma Narrows Bridge Collapse
A real-world example of mechanical resonance and forced vibrations modeled through differential equations. Describes how vortex shedding and aeroelastic instability led to the failure.
