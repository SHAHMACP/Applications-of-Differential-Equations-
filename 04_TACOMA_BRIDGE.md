# Tacoma Bridge Disaster

The first Tacoma Narrows Bridge was a suspension bridge in Washington that spanned the Tacoma Narrows Strait of Puget Sound between Tacoma and the Kitsap Peninsula. It opened to traffic on **July 1, 1940**, and collapsed into Puget Sound on **November 7** of the same year.

From the day of its opening, the bridge began undergoing vertical oscillations and earned the nickname **"Galloping Gertie."** People came from hundreds of miles away to experience the curious thrill of riding over the rolling bridge. As each day passed, the authorities in charge grew more confident about the bridge’s safety, even considering canceling its insurance policy.

On November 7, the entire bridge came crashing down. Fortunately, only one car was on the bridge at the time — belonging to a newspaper reporter who abandoned the car and his pet when the bridge began its violent twisting motion. The reporter reached safety, but his dog remained inside the car and was the only life lost in the disaster.

## Incidents and Irony

There were many humorous and ironic incidents associated with the collapse:

- When the bridge began heaving violently, authorities notified Professor **F.B. Farquharson** of the University of Washington. He had conducted numerous tests on simulated models of the bridge and had assured everyone of its stability.
- Professor Farquharson was the **last person on the bridge.** Even when the span was tilting over 28 feet up and down, he was making scientific observations with little anticipation of the imminent collapse.
- When the motion increased in violence, he made his way to safety — scientifically following the **yellow line** on the road.
- The professor was among the most surprised when the span crashed into the water.

After the collapse, the governor of Washington made an emotional speech, declaring:

> "We are going to build the exact same bridge, exactly as before."

Upon hearing this, the noted engineer **Theodore von Kármán** sent a telegram stating:

> "If you build the exact same bridge exactly as before, it will fall into the exact same river exactly as before."

## Engineering and Responsibility

Leon Moisseiff, who was in charge of the project, had an eye for economy and aesthetics. However, he was **not solely blamed** for the failure.

According to Steinman-Watson:

> "The span failure is not to be blamed on him; the entire profession shares in the responsibility. It is simply that the profession had neglected to combine and apply in time, the knowledge of aerodynamics and dynamic vibrations with its rapidly advancing knowledge of structural design."

## Cause of the Collapse: Stall Flutter

The collapse of the Tacoma Bridge was due to an **aerodynamic phenomenon** known as **stall flutter**.

**Stall flutter** is an **aeroelastic instability** that can affect several systems, such as helicopter blades and wind turbine blades. It leads to **limit cycle oscillations**, causing significant vibration amplitudes, efficiency drops, control difficulties, reduced fatigue life, and sometimes failure.

**Figure 3:** Stall Flutter

This can be explained briefly:

- When there is an obstacle in a stream of air (or liquid), a **vortex street** is formed behind the obstacle.
- A **vortex street** refers to a regular sequence of vortices carried downstream by the fluid flow over a body.

**Figure 4:** Vortex Street

Due to the vortices alternately separating from either side of the obstacle, it experiences a **periodic force** perpendicular to the direction of the stream:

$$
F(t) = F_0 \cos(\omega t)
$$

Where:

- $F_0$ depends on the shape of the structure.
- Poor streamlining increases $F_0$, leading to larger forces.

For example:
- Flow around an airplane at small angles of attack is smooth (small $F_0$).
- In contrast, the poorly streamlined structure of a suspension bridge leads to large forces.

Thus, a structure suspended in an air stream undergoes **forced vibrations**. The danger from this motion depends on how close the structure’s **natural frequency** is to the **frequency of the driving force**.

- If the two frequencies match (**resonance**), the oscillations become destructive if there is insufficient damping.
- It has been established that **resonance due to vortex shedding** was responsible for the Tacoma Bridge collapse.

## Resonance in Other Cases

Resonance effects have been observed elsewhere:

- **Steel factory chimneys** and **submarine periscopes** experience similar vortex-induced vibrations.
- The **Broughton Suspension Bridge** (Manchester, England, 1831) collapsed due to mechanical resonance caused by soldiers marching in step across the bridge.  
  ➔ Soldiers are now ordered to **break step** when crossing bridges to prevent resonance.
- **The Angers Bridge** (France, 1850) collapsed while a battalion of French soldiers crossed during a storm. The wind caused oscillations, and the soldiers' involuntary synchrony amplified the vibrations, leading to collapse.

Similarly, the **London Millennium Bridge** (2000) experienced swaying due to pedestrians inadvertently stepping in rhythm with the bridge's oscillations.

## Key Differences with Tacoma Narrows

- In **Broughton** and **Angers**, the failures were due to precise external periodic forces matching bridge frequencies.
- In **Tacoma**, **mechanical resonance with external forces** (like marching or a precise wind pattern) was **not** the primary culprit.
- Instead, **aeroelastic stall flutter**, an internal instability of the bridge structure itself under wind loads, was responsible.

# Conclusion

The collapse of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge taught engineers the importance of considering **aerodynamic effects** and **dynamic structural responses** in bridge design. The event revolutionized suspension bridge construction and the study of **aeroelastic phenomena**.

# Notes
- Avoid overly simplistic explanations such as purely mechanical resonance for TNB.
- Modern bridges now undergo **wind tunnel testing** and **dynamic analysis** to avoid similar failures.
