## Tacoma Narrows Bridge Collapse


The 1940 collapse of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge is modeled with forced vibrations and resonance phenomena. A differential equation involving periodic forcing explains oscillations caused by vortex shedding (aeroelastic instability).

Key concepts:
- Vortex street
- Forced vibration
- Mechanical resonance
- Eigenfunctions of oscillating structures

Differential equations describe how natural frequencies and external forces interact, leading to structural failure if not properly damped.
