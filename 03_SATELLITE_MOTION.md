## Satellite Motion


Using Newton's laws, satellite paths are modeled as conic sections (ellipses, parabolas, hyperbolas) using polar coordinates. Central force systems yield equations based on gravitational pull:

- F = -GMm/r^2
- r(θ) = l / (1 + e cosθ)

Kepler’s laws are derived from Newton’s laws. Equations help calculate orbit radius, velocity, escape speed, and orbital time. Applications include space engineering and astrophysics.
