Differential equations are one of the fundamental tools used to describe changes in systems across science, engineering, and beyond. They serve as the mathematical language through which we model everything from population growth and planetary motion to electrical circuits and mechanical vibrations.

The origins of differential equations date back to **November 11, 1675**, when **Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz** first used integral calculus to calculate the area under a curve.

> **Definition:**  
> A differential equation is an equation that involves independent and dependent variables along with their derivatives.

Differential equations are essential in describing rates of change and form the basis of mathematical models for physical, biological, and economic systems.

## Classification of Differential Equations

<details>
<summary>Click to Expand</summary>

- **Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE):** Involves derivatives with respect to a single independent variable.
- **Partial Differential Equation (PDE):** Involves partial derivatives with respect to two or more independent variables.
- **Order:** The highest derivative present defines the order.
- **Degree:** The highest exponent of the highest derivative (after clearing radicals and fractions).
- **Linear vs Nonlinear:**
  - **Linear:** Only first-degree variables/derivatives.
  - **Nonlinear:** Contains higher powers or products of variables/derivatives.

- **General Solution:** Contains as many arbitrary constants as the order of the equation.
- **Particular Solution:** Specific solutions derived by assigning values to the constants.
- **Singular Solution:** Solutions that exist independently of the general solution.

- **Variable Separable Method:**  
  Rearrange into $\ f(x)dx + g(y)dy = 0 \$ and integrate separately.
  
- **Homogeneous Differential Equations:**  
  Restructure using substitution if the functions are of the same degree.

- **First-Order Linear Differential Equations:**  
  Of the form $\ \frac{dy}{dx} + P(x)y = Q(x) \$, solved using an integrating factor.
