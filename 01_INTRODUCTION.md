## Introduction


Differential equations describe systems where change occurs continuously. They are used in physics, engineering, biology, economics, and more. This project outlines definitions, classifications (ODEs, PDEs), and general forms such as linear, nonlinear, order, degree, and solution types (general, particular, singular).
