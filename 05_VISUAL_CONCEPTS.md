- **Jacobian Matrix**: Used to analyze the stability of equilibria in nonlinear systems.
- **Isoclines**: Curves where the slope of the direction field is constant.
- **Phase Plane & Portrait**: Visual tools showing system trajectories based on initial conditions.
- **Types of Equilibria**: Node, Saddle, Spiral, Center, etc.
